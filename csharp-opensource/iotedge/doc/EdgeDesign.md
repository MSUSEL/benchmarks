Edge Runtime
------------

The IoT Edge Runtime manages high-value services running on devices and enables communication between them. It allows workflows running on devices to be configured, deployed and monitored from the cloud - securely and at scale.

### Edge Agent

  The edge agent is designed to communicate with IoT Hub in order to manage the state of the Edge device (install, launch and monitor modules).
  
#### Assemblies

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.Core**

  The core functionality of the agent

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.Docker**

  Docker is the first of several underlying technologies used to support module management.

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.IoTHub**

  IoT Hub hosts the device twin of the edge agent. Through the model of eventual consistency, the IoT Hub twin acts as an interactive configuration interface for the edge agent.

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Agent.Service**

  The service is a long-running application that hosts the edge  agent.

### Edge Hub

#### Assemblies

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Hub.CloudProxy**

  The backing conduit to Azure IoT Hub. The cloud proxy will deliver all messages between the Edge Hub and the Azure IoT Hub.

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Hub.Core**

  The core functionality of the edge hub

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Hub.Http**

  The HTTP head allows modules to invoke direct methods on other modules. Previously, such functionality was only available through the cloud service, down to devices.

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Hub.Mqtt**

  The MQTT head allows devices and modules that would typically communicate directly with the Azure IoT Hub via MQTT, to communicate with/through the Edge Hub instead.

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Hub.Service**

  The service is a long-running application that hosts the edge hub.

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Routing.Core**

  The routing core is an engine that receives every message generated by any module or device connected to the Edge Hub. Based on routes provided to the Edge Hubâ€™s twin (or a configuration json-file supplied during launch), it will determine the end-point(s) of all messages generated by the modules.

### Edge Utility Library

#### Assemblies

- **Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Edge.Util**

  The utilities found in the Edge Util assembly provide components that enable patterns and practices common in other languages but not native to C#.

  - ##### `Option` type

    In many cases, `null` is used to represent an optional value, particularly in public APIs. The problem with this approach is that there is no way to determine, or specify, via the type signature of a function or method that the return value is optional. In these cases we should use the [`Option`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type) type to handle cases where a value may be optional. This makes optional return values explicit and aides the consumer of the API in dealing with the fact that the result of a function may not have a value.

    > ***NOTE:** We have brought over an implementation of the `Option` type from the IoT Hub project, which is modeled after Scala's option type.*


User-defined Modules
--------------------

User-defined modules allow companies or individuals to create custom or tailored solutions specific to their needs which can be managed by the Edge Runtime. User-defined modules communicate with the Azure IoT Hub via the Edge Hub, and are deployed, configured and managed via the Module Management Agent.

> For information about developing user-defined modules, please view the [*Specification for Edge Runtime Configuration*](./EdgeRuntimeConfigSpec.md).

### Example Modules

- **BLE Module**

  This Azure Edge sample showcases how one can take an existing IoT Gateway module that interacts with physical hardware, package it into a container and have it interact with the Edge runtime.
