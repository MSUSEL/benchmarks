# Serialization

RestSharp has JSON and XML serializers built in without any additional packages
or configuration. There are also a few JSON serializers provided as additional packages.

:::tip
The default behavior of RestSharp is to swallow deserialization errors and return `null` in the `Data`
property of the response. Read more about it in the [Error Handling](exceptions.md).
:::

## Default Serializers

The default JSON serializer uses the forked version of `SimpleJson`. It is very simplistic and
doesn't handle advanced scenarios in many cases. We do not plan to fix or add new features
to the default JSON serializer, since it handles a lot of cases already and when you need
to handle more complex objects, please consider using alternative JSON serializers mentioned below.

You can use either the default XML serializer or the `DotNetXmlSerializer`, which uses `System.Xml.Serialization` library
from .NET. To use the `DotNetXmlSerializer` you need to configure the REST client instance:

```csharp
client.UseDotNetXmlSerializer();
```

## NewtonsoftJson (aka Json.Net)

The `NewtonsoftJson` package is the most popular JSON serializer for .NET.
It handles all possible scenarios and is very configurable. Such a flexibility
comes with the cost of performance. If you need something faster, please check
`Utf8Json` or `System.Text.Json` serializers (below).

RestSharp support Json.Net serializer via a separate package. You can install it
from NuGet:

```
dotnet add package RestSharp.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson
```

Use the extension method provided by the package to configure the client:

```csharp
client.UseNewtonsoftJson();
```

The serializer configures some options by default:

```csharp
JsonSerializerSettings DefaultSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
{
    ContractResolver     = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver(),
    DefaultValueHandling = DefaultValueHandling.Include,
    TypeNameHandling     = TypeNameHandling.None,
    NullValueHandling    = NullValueHandling.Ignore,
    Formatting           = Formatting.None,
    ConstructorHandling  = ConstructorHandling.AllowNonPublicDefaultConstructor
};
```

If you need to use different settings, you can supply your instance of
`JsonSerializerSettings` as a parameter for the extension method.

## Utf8Json

The 'Utf8Json' package is known to be the fastest JSON serializer for .NET.

RestSharp supports `Utf8Json` serializer via a separate package. You can install it
from NuGet:

```
dotnet add package RestSharp.Serializers.Utf8Json
```

Configure your REST client using the extension method:

```csharp
client.UseUtf8Json();
``` 

When the extension method is called without parameters, it will configure
the default options:

 - Allow private properties
 - Exclude null values
 - Use camel-case

If you need to use different options, you can provide the instance of
`IJsonFormatterResolver` as a parameter for the extension method.

:::warning
Keep in mind that this serializer is case-sensitive by default.
:::

## System.Text.Json

Microsoft included the new JSON serializer package `System.Text.Json` together with .NET Core 3.
It is a small and fast serializer that is used in the WebApi version for .NET Core 3
and beyond by default. The package is also available for .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and higher.

RestSharp supports `System.Text.Json` serializer via a separate package. You can install it
from NuGet:

```
dotnet add package RestSharp.Serializers.SystemTextJson
```

Configure your REST client using the extension method:

```csharp
client.UseSystemTextJson();
``` 

The serializer will use default options, unless you provide your
own instance of `JsonSerializerOptions` to the extension method.

:::warning
Keep in mind that this serializer is case-sensitive by default.

## Custom

You can also implement your custom serializer. To support both serialization and
deserialization, you must implement the `IRestSerializer` interface.

Here is an example of a custom serializer that uses `System.Text.Json`:

```csharp
public class SimpleJsonSerializer : IRestSerializer
{
    public string Serialize(object obj) => JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj);

    public string Serialize(Parameter bodyParameter) => Serialize(bodyParameter.Value);

    public T Deserialize<T>(IRestResponse response) => JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(response.Content);

    public string[] SupportedContentTypes { get; } =
    {
        "application/json", "text/json", "text/x-json", "text/javascript", "*+json"
    };

    public string ContentType { get; set; } = "application/json";

    public DataFormat DataFormat { get; } = DataFormat.Json;
}
```

The value of the `SupportedContentTypes` property will be used to match the
serializer with the response `Content-Type` headers.

The `ContentType` property will be used when making a request so the
server knows how to handle the payload.
